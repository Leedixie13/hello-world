# hello-world
My first repository. Used for Practice/Development and Feedback

My name is Michael Dix and I am an aspiring Software Developer! 

I have always been interested in technology since a young age.
From jailbreaking iPods to creating offline software builds,
I see this time in my life as a turning point to start my journey 
into the real nit-and-grit of developing and to start capitalizing!
